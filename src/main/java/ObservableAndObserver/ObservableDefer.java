/*
* Defer
This operator does not create the ObservableAndObserver until the Observer subscribes.
The only downside to defer() is that it creates a new ObservableAndObserver each time you get a new Observer.
create() can use the same function for each subscriber, so itâ€™s more efficient.

Sample Implementation: The below sample creates an ObservableAndObserver using ObservableAndObserver.defer() method.
The below code creates an ObservableAndObserver that emits a value.

So sometimes we have state changes then the observable once used it wont keep track of state changes

        // before we are subscribing to another observer and we expect
        // to print till 15 but it won't that's because it didn't catch the state changes
        // because it is created before with the values. so in these cases we use defer
        // because it creates the observable only when it is subscribes.
